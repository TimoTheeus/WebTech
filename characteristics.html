      <h1>Physical Characteristics</h1>
      
      <p>The fennec fox weighs about 1.5–3.5 lb (0.68–1.59 kg), with a body length of between 24–41 cm (9–16 in); it
      is around 20.3 cm (8 in) tall. It is the smallest species of canid in the world. The tail has a black tip and
      is 18–31 cm (7–12 in) long, while the ears can be between 10–15 cm (3.9–5.9 in) long.</p>

      <p>The coat is often a cream color and fluffy, which deflects heat during the day and keeps the fox warm at night.
      The fennec's characteristic ears are the largest among all foxes relative to body size, and serve to dissipate heat,
      as they have many blood vessels close to the skin.[8] The ears of a fennec are sensitive enough to hear prey that may
      be underground; the soles of its feet are protected from the hot desert sand by thick fur.</p>
