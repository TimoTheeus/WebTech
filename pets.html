      <h1>As Pets</h1>
      <p>The fennec fox is bred commercially as an exotic house pet. Breeders tend to remove the young kits from the
      mother to hand-rear, as owners prefer tamer and more handleable foxes, thereby making them more expensive.</p>
      
      <p>The species is classified a "small wild/exotic canid" by the United States Department of Agriculture, along
      with the coyote, dingo, jackal, and Arctic fox, and is considered the only species of fox, other than the
      Russian domesticated red fox, which can properly be kept as a pet. Although it cannot be considered domesticated,
      it can be kept in a domestic setting similar to dogs or cats. A breeders' registry has been set up in the
      United States to avoid any problems associated with inbreeding. The legality of owning a fennec fox varies by
      jurisdiction, as with many exotic pets.</p>
      
      <p>A fennec fox named Finnick was depicted in Disney's Zootopia. As a result of the popularity of the movie, the
      Los Angeles Times reported that Chinese children are begging their parents to procure the animals as pets.</p>
